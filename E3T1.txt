# Research the AWS Guard Duty documentation page and explain how GuardDuty may have detected this attack - i.e. what was its source of information.

With the help of VPC Flow Logs GuardDuty, most likely GuardDuty discovered the attack which captured information about the Ip traffic sent and received from the EC2 network interface in the Virtual Private Cloud.
