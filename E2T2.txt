Research and analyze which of the vulnerabilities appear to be related to the code that was deployed for the environment in this project.

Enforcement of the use of non-root account is missing.
IAM policy is weak as it allows full administrative rights.
All ingress and egress traffic is allowed by VPC security groups.
Redirection requests from HTTP to HTTPS are not carried out by the Loadbalancer.
IAM password policy is not specified.
TCP port 5000 is accessible from the internet on EC2 instance.
Trail of CloudTrail is not specified.
SSH is listening on port 22 on the EC2 instance. 


Bonus - provide recommendations on how to remediate the vulnerabilities.
Set IAM policies to enforce MFS and deny root user.
Make IAM policy strong.
Limit the traffic on VPC security groups.
Redirecting HTTP to HTTPS and limiting traffic on the Loadbalancer.
Implement strict IAM password policy.
Close all non-necessary ports including port 22 on the EC2 instance.
Create CloudTrail which will be stored on S3.
