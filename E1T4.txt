#Poor Practice 1

Problem: All the traffic from all the ports is allowed by both private and public subnet network ACL rules.

Problem: All the S3 buckets are currently accessible from the application server that is none of the buckets are encrypted and can be accessed by the users.

Fix: The instance role policy should define the particular policy (Free Recipe) that can be accessed from the application server.
