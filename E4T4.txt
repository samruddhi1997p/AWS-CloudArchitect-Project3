# What additional architectural change can be made to reduce the internet facing attack surface of the web application instance.

Allow access to the internet only through security groups.
Block EC2 instance root SSH login

# Assuming the IAM permissions for the S3 bucket are still insecure, would creating VPC private endpoints for S3 prevent the unauthorized access to the secrets bucket.

No, using VPC private endpoints cannot prevent unauthorized access to the secrets bucket. But as the data travel on the AWS network, the communication will be faster and cheaper.

# Will applying default encryption setting to the s3 buckets encrypt the data that already exists?

No, encryption can't be implemented on exisiting files.

# What would happen if the original cloud formation templates are applied to this environment.

The application would go back to its initial state and the changes would be outrun.
